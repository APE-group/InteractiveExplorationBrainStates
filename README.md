Interactive Exploration of Brain States and Spatio-Temporal Activity Patterns in Data-Constrained Simulations

How the same network can generate different brain states with their specific propagation patterns and rhythms?

In this Jupyter Lab environment, the user can interactively change the neuromodulated fatigue parameters and observe in real-time the emergence of different categories of slow-wave wave-propagation patterns and the transition to an asynchronous regime on a columnar mean-field model equipped with lateral connections inferred from experimentally acquired cortical activity.
The model displays the dorsal view of a mouse cortical hemisphere sampled by pixels of 100-micron size over a 25 mm2 field of view.

The connectivity of the model was inferred from cortical activity acquired using GECI imaging technique. Even if the connectivity of the model was inferred from a single brain-state, the neuromodulated model supports the emergence of a rich dynamic repertoire of spatio-temporal propagation patterns, from those corresponding to deepests levels of anesthesia (spirals) to classical postero-anterior and rostro-caudal waves up to the transition to asynchronous activity, with the dissolution of the slow-wave features (1).

The experimental data set from which the model has been inferred has been provided by LENS and it is available in the EBRAINS KG (2).

The analyses of slow-wave features in the experimental and modeled data were based on the analysis pipeline design presented in (3).

The predecessor of this model can be found at (4).

The latest version of the code presented in the drive of this collab can be found in this github.

The interactive model is registered in the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph at (6)
